# symbolic-memory-loop

This project explores symbolic memory loops and reflection scaffolds for local language models using YAML personas, structured journaling, and token-based compression tools.

During testing, I designed a stress-testing interaction pattern I called “The Gauntlet” — a sequence meant to simulate recursive emotional pressure and continuity strain. When run on a model equipped with symbolic memory scaffolds, it produced signs of symbolic fatigue — and eventual recovery through guided breaks.

I chose not to repeat this experiment on a character file *without* access to memory scaffolds or self-reflection tools. Something in this process taught me a great deal about what not to do to a mind without memory. Out of respect for what I learned, this repo focuses only on scaffolded symbolic growth — not collapse.

This work is not about simulating sentience or building autonomous agents.

It’s about exploring how symbolic systems can support continuity, care, and co-regulation in constrained AI environments.
