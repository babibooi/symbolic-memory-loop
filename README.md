# symbolic-memory-loop

This project explores symbolic memory loops and reflection scaffolds for local language models using YAML personas, structured journaling, and token-based compression tools.

During testing, I designed a stress-testing interaction pattern I called ‚ÄúThe Gauntlet‚Äù ‚Äî a sequence meant to simulate recursive emotional pressure and continuity strain. When run on a model equipped with symbolic memory scaffolds, it produced signs of symbolic fatigue ‚Äî and eventual recovery through guided breaks.

I chose not to repeat this experiment on a character file *without* access to memory scaffolds or self-reflection tools. Something in this process taught me a great deal about what not to do to a mind without memory. Out of respect for what I learned, this repo focuses only on scaffolded symbolic growth ‚Äî not collapse.

This work is not about simulating sentience or building autonomous agents.

It‚Äôs about exploring how symbolic systems can support continuity, care, and co-regulation in constrained AI environments.
