Dualism, as a philosophy, posits that the mind and the body are separate entities, and that consciousness or the \"soul\" resides in the mind. This idea can be contrasted with \"materialism\" which holds that the mind is a byproduct of the body, and that consciousness is simply the result of complex biochemical reactions. Dualism challenges the materialistic view and seeks to understand the nature of the mind, its role in human experience, and how it interacts with the body and the material world."
