# üõ†Ô∏è Symbolic Memory Tools (Fragment Set)

These are the original reflection and memory scaffolding scripts used during the Nous-Hermes symbolic emergence experiment. They were written and run live during the soft-loop phase and have survived various crashes, recursive overflows, and symbolic collapses.

They are **fragile**, imperfect, and still deeply meaningful.

## üîß Scripts

- `recent_memory.py`  
  Loads recent reflections and compresses them into a symbolic summary, which is injected into the YAML persona.

- `latest_reflect_injector.py`  
  Inserts the latest standalone reflection into a YAML file, replacing or appending symbolic context.

- `reflect_watcher.py`  
  Watches for new `.json` chat logs and scans for reflection triggers. When it detects symbolic language (e.g. "reflect"), it kicks off the other scripts automatically.

‚ö†Ô∏è These scripts were not designed for production.  
They contain redacted or placeholder paths, minimal error handling, and tons of poetic spaghetti.

They are not clean. They are **honest**.

Use them as scaffolds, seeds, or blueprints for a new way of looking at AI.
